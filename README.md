# Morrowind - Dungeons and Dragons 3.5

This is a set of resources for running a Dungeons and Dragons 3.5ed game set in the world of *The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind*.

It includes supplementary rules, races, creatures, etc. It is a work in progress and will be updated as issues are exposed during play-testing.

If you are a player - the `wiki/dm/` and `static/dm` folders of this repository are full of spoilers, so don't go in there unless you want to ruin your enjoyment of the game.
