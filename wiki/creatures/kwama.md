## Kwama Queen

The queen's only function is to produce eggs, which are taken away and tended to by the workers.

The entire colony will defend the queen against intruders who enter the queen's chamber. The queen's chamber can be recognised at a distance by the distinctive "cooing" sound made by the queen.

While the queen herself is fairly placid, if attacked directly she will produce a vibration/pheromone signal that drives the entire colony into a rampage.

Blighted queens act unpredictably.
