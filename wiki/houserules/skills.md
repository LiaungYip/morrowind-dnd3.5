### Recursive Skill Synergy Bonuses

For **each** 5 ranks a character has in a skill, they gain a +2 bonus on synergised skill checks. For example, a character with 10 ranks in Jump gains a +4 bonus to Tumble checks.

*Default ([from SRD](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)): If a character has 5 or more ranks in a skill, they get a +2 bonus to synergised skill checks.*

### Stealth and Acuity

* Spot and Listen are combined into one skill called **Acuity** (WIS).
 	* Anything which affects your Spot or Listen modifier instead affects your Acuity modifier.
 	* Anything which requires Spot or Listen as a pre-requisite now requires Acuity.
 	* Anything which grants Spot or Listen as a class skill, now grants Acuity as a class skill.
	* Things which affect **both** Spot and Listen overlap (they do not stack.) i.e. the Alertness feat, which normally grants +2 Spot and +2 Listen, only grants +2 Acuity, not +4 Acuity.
* Hide and Move Silently are combined into one skill called **Stealth** (DEX).
	* Rules are as above for Acuity.

### Specific Classes

* Fighters and Rangers gain Tumble as a class skill. (This was already possible using the [Cityscape Web Enhancement](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070228a1).)
* Sorcerors have a revised class skill list. See the [Spellcasters](/houserules/spellcasters) page.
