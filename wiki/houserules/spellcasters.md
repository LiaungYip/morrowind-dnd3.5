### 0-level spells (cantrips and orisons)

All classes able to cast 0th-level spells may spontaneously cast each 0th-level spell they know up to three times per day, plus a modifier equal to the highest level spell the character knows.

Of the PHB classes, this includes bards, clerics, druids, sorcerors, and wizards. Rangers and paladins cannot cast 0th level spells.

Examples:

* A Wiz 5 knows 3rd level spells. He can cast cantrips 6/day.
* A Wiz 3/Clr 3/Mystic Theurge 2 knows 3rd level arcane and 3rd level divine spells. He can cast cantrips 6/day.

### Versatile Spellcaster

*(feat, Races of the Dragon pg. 101)*

* You can only convert spell slots into higher/lower spell slots from the same spellcasting class.
* Using divine spell slots to cast arcane spells, or vice versa, is specifically banned.
* Similarly, sacrificing spontaneous spellcasting slots to cast from your prepared spellcasting spell list (and vice versa) is specifically banned.
* You cannot convert 0-level spells into 1st-level spells.

### Sorcerer adjustments

Sorcerors are illiterate like Barbarians, and therefore unable to cast from scrolls. (A sorceror who gains literacy remains unable to read from scrolls, regardless.)

In return, gain:

* Hit dice d6. (normally: d4.)
* light armour proficiency and armoured casting similar to Bard - no arcane spell failure chance for sorceror spell casting while wearing no armour or light armour. Note the armoured casting benefit does not extend to other spellcasting classes you may have.
* Skill ranks 4+INT per level (times 4 at first level)
* Class skills - Acuity, Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Knowledge (arcana, daedra, nature, Morrowind, Empire),  Stealth, Survival, Spellcraft.

Additionally:

* At every odd level after 1st, a Sorcerer will receive 1 spell known in their next spell level (at 3rd they get 1 2nd level spell; at 5th they get 1 3rd level spell, at 7th they get 1 4th level spell, etc).
* Likewise, at every odd level after 1st, a Sorcerer will receive 3 spells per day in their next spell level (as indicated above).
* Note that later levels are unaltered. For example, at 4th level, you will still only have 1 2nd level spell known, and only 3 2nd level spells per day - as per the normal sorcerer rules. The intent of this change is to grant earlier access to new spell levels, not to increase the class's overall progression.

This way, sorcerors gain access to higher-level spells at the same rate that wizards do.

Note the granted skills list is a bit different from Julian's.

### Consequences for death of familiar

The RAW rules for death of a familiar (PHB pg 54) are as quoted below:

> If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

These rules are replaced by:

> If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorceror, the sorceror is nauseated and frightened for one day.
> 
> Succeeding on a Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to the sickened  effect. Succeeding on a Will save reduces the frightened effect to the shaken effect. The Fortitude and Will saving throw DCs are equal to 15 + 1/2 character level (round down.)
> 
> Creatures which are immune to fear automatically succeed on the Will saving throw, and are always shaken.
> 
> A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.
