# Arms, Armour, and Items

### Items

See also the list of banned items.

#### Nightstick

*(item, Libris Mortis pg. 78)*

The Nightstick grants 4/day extra uses of the Turn Undead or Rebuke Undead ability to a character who already has one of those abilities.

You cannot make use of multiple Nightsticks. Nightsticks cannot grant more than four additional uses of Turn/Rebuke Undead per day.

The Nightstick has four 'charges' per day which are expended as you use the turn attempts. Giving a partially charged Nightstick to someone else does not recharge it.

#### Beekeeper's Suit

*(Arms and Equipment 3.0)*

You cannot wear a Beekeeper's Suit over other armour.

The Beekeeper's suit is considered to be light armour with maximum dexterity +8, ACP 0, and 5% arcane spell failure chance.

#### "Buttons" and other custom magic items

The Dungeon Master's Guide section on estimating the value of custom magic items, is treated as advice only.

* 'buttons' are likely to be artifact level items, and available only as phat loot with value beyond measure.
* The guidelines for reducing item cost based on skill, alignment, class, or race, only apply for items you find. In any case, such bonuses never stack.

("buttons" are infinite use/day spell effect items, command-word activated or use-activated.)

### Weapon Groups

#### Weapon specific feats

All feats providing bonuses to the use of one weapon, i.e. Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, etc, now apply to groups of similar weapons.

For example, Weapon Focus (Flails and Chains) applies to a group of weapons including the light flail, heavy flail, and exotic weapons as listed below.

The groups of weapons are as per Unearthed Arcana pp 94-97 ([see d20 SRD.](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/weaponGroupFeats.htm))

#### Exotic Weapon Proficiency

When taking the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, you gain proficiency with an entire class of exotic weapons.

For example, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Flails and Chains) grants proficiency with the chain-and-dagger, scourge, spiked chain, three-section-staff, whip, and whip-dagger.

#### Bonus weapon proficiencies

##### Stalwart Sorceror

Bonus weapon proficiency / weapon focus applies to all simple and martial weapons in a weapon group of the character's choice, per Unearthed Arcana.

If the character additionally takes the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, they may also use the exotic weapons in the chosen weapon group.

##### Cleric, War domain

Instead of a deity having a favoured weapon, they have a favoured weapon group. The favoured weapon group is the one which contains the deity's favoured weapon.

Example: Molag Bal's favoured weapon is the mace. His favoured weapon group is 'maces and clubs', which includes club, light mace, heavy mace, greatclub, quarterstaff, and sap.

A cleric of the War domain gains proficiency and Weapon Focus with all simple and martial weapons in their deity's favoured weapon group.

If the character additionally takes the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, they may also use the exotic weapons in their deity's favoured weapon group.

### Firing defensively

When firing a ranged weapon, you can make a Tumble check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity. The Tumble DC is 15 for a single attack, +4 for each iterative attack you choose to make this round.

Success means that your attack(s) do not provoke an attack of opportunity. Failure means that your attack(s) are wasted.

The Tumble check is not a separate action; it is performed as part of your attack action.
