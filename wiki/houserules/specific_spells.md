# Specific Spells

----

### Power Word: Pain

*(Races of the Dragon, pg 116)*

The damage dealt by this spell is changed from 1d6 lethal to 1d4 non-lethal.

The creature is shaken for the duration of the spell (Will negates.)

----

### Wings of Cover

*(Races of the Dragon)*

The spell grants +8 AC and +4 reflex save against a single attack, instead of total cover.

Also note RAW, the spell description state you have to declare use of this spell before the attack is made. (The attacker then gets a chance to ignore you and do something else.)

----

### Launch Bolt

*(Spell Compendium pg. 130)*

You can launch a bolt of your size without penalty. That is, medium-sized casters can launch medium-sized crossbow bolts.

If you attempt to launch a bolt that is larger than your size, you suffer an attack penalty as if you are using a weapon that is too large for you.

*(Why varied: The RAW version of Launch Bolt does not prohibit a medium-sized creature launching colossal-size crossbow bolts.)*
