# House Rules

Brief outline is below - not necessarily complete. See specific pages for full details.

	* Light shields are buffed to +2 AC and Heavy shields are buffed to +3 AC.
	* Nerfs to Nightstick, Beekeeper's Suit, and "Buttons" (use-activated spell effect items.)
	* Weapon Focus and similar feats - buffed to apply to *groups* of similar weapons
	* Firing Defensively - Tumble check to avoid attack of opportunity when using missile weapons at close range (similar to spellcasting defensively)
* [Specific Spells](/houserules/specific_spells)
	* Power Word: Pain - nerfed to non-lethal damage. Can now be used to torture without killing, which seems fitting.

	* Versatile Spellcaster - nerfed.

	* Favoured Soul and Warmage - faster spell level progression.
	* Dual casting classes (i.e. Mystic Theurge, Ultimate Magus) - lower entry prerequisites.
	* Consequences for death of familiar - made far more lenient.
