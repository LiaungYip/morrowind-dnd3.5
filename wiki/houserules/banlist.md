### Banlist

This banlist is generic for all DnD 3.5 games, and includes things that are not found in the Morrowind setting.

#### Hard banned

* All DnD 3.0e content unless explicitly allowed. Includes:
	* Oriental Adventures
	* Serpent Kingdoms
	* Iron Kingdoms
	* Savage Species
	* Magic of Incarnum
* Items
	* Candle of Invocation (SRD) - allows infinite wish cycle.
* Feats
	* Initiate of Mystra (Player's Guide to Faerun pg. 81) - Excessively powerful.
	* Leadership (PHB) - allows recursive cohorts.

* Races
	* Pazuzu - used to build Pun-Pun.
	* Sarrukh - used to build Pun-Pun.
* Weapon Enchantments
	* Valorous (Magic Item Compendium) - allows excessively high damage multipliers on charge attacks.
* Spell
	* Ice Assassin (Frostburn) - allows body-swapping.
	* Guidance of the Avatar (WotC web supplement) - +20 skill check bonus from a Clr 2 spell is overpowered. Use Divine Insight (Spell Compendium pg 70 - Clr/Pal 2) instead.
* Books
	* Oriental Adventures - equipment is banned, classes are OK.
* Psionics
	* Including Psionics, Truenaming, and Soulmelds.

#### Soft banned

* Items
	* Dastana and Chahar-aina (armour)
* Lesser Planestouched races (LA +0) - all the benefits of a Planestouched race and none of the LA.
* Flaws from Unearthed Arcana (pg. 91) or Dragon Magazines
* Traits from Unearthed Arcana (pg. 86) or Dragon Magazines
* Templates
* Warforged
* Bloodlines - due to problems with "level buyoff" rules, and also because there is nothing to crossbreed with in the Morrowind setting. People mainly wanted a way to get early entry into dual casting classes; the correct fix is to change the entry requirements to these classes.
* LA using level buyoff

#### Things that are no longer banned

* Nightsticks - house-ruled into sanity.
* Dragonfire Inspiration - house-ruled into sanity.
* White Raven Tactics - official WotC errata'd into sanity.
