Page 94 - **White Raven Tactics** [Addition and Clarification]
You cannot target yourself, despite being your own ally (as doing so results in an infinite penalty to your initiative count). Add "A creature can only be affected by one White Raven Tactics per encounter." to the end of the maneuver's text.

Other important errata:

Page 28 - **Adaptive Style** [Clarification]
Changing your maneuvers with Adaptive Style also recovers expended maneuvers, as though you had spent the normal 5 minutes readying them.

Pages 63 & 64 - **Insightful Strike** [Addition]
Summary of errata: This maneuver can deal critical damage.

Page 68 - **Iron Heart Surge** [Clarification]
Summary of errata: Iron Heart Surge is capable of removing one effect, from a specified list of effects. The effect is removed but not the cause (the effect may be reapplied next turn.)

In case of Iron Heart Surge affecting a spell or other ability that affects an area (such as the web spell), the entire effect is ended for everyone involved when Iron Heart Surge resolves.

Page 79 - **Shadow Jaunt** [Addition]
Summary of errata: You can only bring a limited amount of material with you. You can't bring other creatures.

Page 81 - **Ancient Mountain Hammer** [Addition]
Summary of errata: You can use the Mountain Hammer maneuvers to make a Sunder attempt without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Page 89 - **Sudden Leap** [Clarification]
This Jump check follows the normal rules for Jump checks, and has a higher DC if you do not have a 20ft running start.
