This is a set of resources for running a Dungeons and Dragons 3.5ed game set in the world of *The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind*.

It includes supplementary rules, races, creatures, etc. It is a work in progress and will be updated as issues are exposed during play-testing.

Information is included for players and DM's. It is assumed that the players have never played the Morrowind PC game. As such, the spoiler-filled "DM-only" information, relating to plot events and session-planning resources, is kept behind weak password protection to discourage casual snooping.

## Suggestions? Improvements?

The Markdown source code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiaungYip/morrowind-dnd3.5). *(Note for players: "DM-only" information is exposed at this link. Do not delve into it unless you want to spoil the game for yourself!)*

You can raise any issues or suggestions at the [GitHub issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/LiaungYip/morrowind-dnd3.5/issues). Pull requests are also welcome.
