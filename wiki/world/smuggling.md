# Smuggling

With a large selection of easily moved, high-value import and export goods, a strong tradition of organised crime, and long stretches of un-patrolled coastline, Vvardenfell is a smuggler's paradise.

Goods smuggled out of Vvardenfell include:

* raw materials like ebony and glass, which are otherwise monopolised by the East Empire Company
* ancient Dwemer artifacts, which Vvardenfell has in abundance, but whose trade is prohibited under law.

Goods smuggled into Vvardenfell include:

* Illegal drugs, i.e. Skooma and Moon Sugar
* Luxury goods - such as distilled alcohol and jewellry - to avoid import taxes. 
* Slaves - from other provinces. Morrowind is the only Imperial province where slavery is legal; House Dren uses slave labour extensively to produce agricultural exports at very low cost.
