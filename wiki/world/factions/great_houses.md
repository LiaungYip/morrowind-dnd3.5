#Great Houses

(This page is a work in progress.)

## House Telvanni

House Telvanni is based in the sparsely settled plains of the Grazelands and the desolate stretches of Azura's Coast. As a house headed by aloof mage-lords, primarily concerned with arcane studies, the isolation of these areas is taken as a blessing.

House Telvanni is xenophobic and highly competitive. There is a pervasive culture of "might makes right". Slaves are extensively used to perform manual labour.

House Telvanni is currently in a phase of aggressive expansion.

## House Redoran

House Redoran is based in the Ashlands around Red Mountain. Their house seat is at Ald'Ruhn.

The Redoran are the traditional defenders of Morrowind, with a strong military focus and a culture of 'duty and piety'.

Their fortunes are in decline due to the continuing troubles at Red Mountain, and the increasing frequency of ash storms and blight. 

## House Hlaalu

House Hlaalu are based in the hospitable Wesh Gash region of Vvardenfell. House Hlaalu has formed close relations with the Empire to further its own goals of commercial and industrial dominance.

As Imperial sympathisers, House Hlaalu's fortunes have risen with the increasing Imperial presence on Vvardenfell. Due to their rapid adoption of Imperial values, House Hlaalu are the only house to discourage the institution of slavery.

Profit is king. Corruption, underhanded tactics, and dirty tricks are expected and encouraged.
