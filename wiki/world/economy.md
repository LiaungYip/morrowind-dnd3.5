# Economy

Primary production accounts for the majority of Vvardenfell's exports.

## Main exports

### Agriculture

Vvardenfell has a low population and large tracts of fertile land. The developing agricultural industry is a net exporter of food, with the main exports being grains (such as saltrice and wickwheat).

The expanding plantations controlled by House Dres use slave labour to keep costs low. While the Empire officially frowns on slavery, there is always an Imperial merchant willing to buy the cheap grain.

### Ebony and glass

Vvardenfell has rich deposits of ebony and glass, some of the most valuable materials in the Empire. These materials are durable volcanic glasses which are somewhat malleable and workable like metal. They are used to create arms and armour of the highest quality.

While there are some local mining concerns, the bulk of ebony and glass extraction is performed by Imperial-owned concerns. The trade in ebony and glass is monopolised by the East Empire Company.
