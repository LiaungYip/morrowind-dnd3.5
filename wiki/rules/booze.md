#Booze

Booze (alcoholic drinks) are a cheap way to become as strong as an ox, provided you don't mind being as *dumb* as an ox.

## Drinking booze

Drinking a serving of booze is a full-round action, with the effect taking hold after a minute (10 rounds).

If you drink so much that one of your ability scores is reduced to zero, you collapse (unconscious) in a drunken stupor.

**Booze is considered a poison.** This implies that Argonians derive no benefits or penalties from booze. It also implies that *Neutralise Poison* is an effective hangover remedy.

## Effects of booze

Drinking booze enhances some of your abilities while penalising others.

* **BONUSES:** Booze bonuses are morale bonuses which stack with other booze bonuses, but not with other morale bonuses (such as bard-song.)
* **PENALTIES:** Booze penalties are untyped bonuses which stack with everything, including other booze penalties.
* **DURATION:** Booze effects last one hour.
	* Exception: If you cure the booze penalties (i.e. using *Neutralise Poison*) then you immediately lose the booze benefits.
	* Exception: If you temporarily suppress the booze penalties (i.e. using *Delay Poison*) then the booze benefits are likewise suppressed.

### Table: Types of Booze

| Quality | Name | Cost | Weight (per serving) | Effects | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | -------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Cheap | Mazte | 5 cp | 1 lb | +2 STR, -2 WIS, -2 INT | Cheap and nasty drink made from fermented saltrice. (Rice wine) |
| Cheap | Shein | 1 sp | 0.5 lb | +2 CON, -2 INT | A wine made from comberries. (Red wine) |
| Average | Greef | 2 gp | 0.1 lb | +2 STR, -2 DEX | A brandy made from comberries. (Port) |
| Average | Sujamma | 10 gp | 0.1 lb | +4 STR, -4 INT | A potent spirit distilled from Mazte. (Vodka) |
| Expensive | Cyrodillic Brandy | 100 gp | 0.05 lb | +2 CON, +2 CHA, -2 WIS | An Imperial distilled brandy. |
| Expensive | Flin | 100 gp | 0.05 lb | +2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 DEX | An Imperial distilled whiskey. |

A bottle of Flin (1 lb, 20 servings) is very expensive, costing 2,000 gp. The high price and small weight of imported booze makes it popular with smugglers evading Imperial Census and Excise agents.

### Table: Random Booze Penalties

In addition to the penalties from *Table: Types of Booze*, every drink of booze also incurs a random penalty from the table below.

## Design notes

The additional random penalties are designed to prevent players from maximising their strength by drinking until they are (nearly) unconscious from ability score drain, i.e. STR 32 (+11) and INT 1 (-5).
