#Criminal Background

All players begin as prisoners, who are being transported from the Imperial City prison to the far away province of Morrowind.

Pick one of the crimes below. You gain one free rank in the associated skill, and it becomes a class skill for you (regardless of your class.)

**Note:** Your character does not necessarily have to have committed the crime they were convicted for. They may have been framed.

| Crime            | Skill            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Pickpocketing    | Disguise         |
| Murder           | Intimidate       |
| Barratry         | Bluff            |
| Horse Rustling   | Ride             |
| Poaching         | Survival         |
| Shoplifting      | Sleight of Hand  |
| Prostitution     | Use Rope         |
| Embezzeling      | Forgery          |
| Smuggling        | Appraise         |
| Daedra Worship   | Decipher Script  |
| Cattle Raiding   | Handle Animal    |
| Break and Enter  | Escape Artist    |

**Note:** The exact crime your character was convicted of is for flavour only - you can be imprisoned for any crime you like, i.e. 'defamation', 'vandalism'. However the list of skills is fixed and no substitutions are permitted.

### Design note

The list of skills is purposely intended to represent skills that are rarely taken in combat-optimised character builds.
