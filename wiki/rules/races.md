# Races

There are ten races in Morrowind - a few kinds of humans, a few kinds of elves, orcs, and two "beast races" - the Khajit "cat people" and the Argonian "lizard-people".

There was once a race of dwarves (dwemer) reknowned for their mechanical skill and cunning artifice. However all dwemer have disappeared, having vanished in a single night. Their cities, as extensive underground as above-ground, remain as slowly crumbling ruins, still guarded by tireless automatons.

## Altmer (high elves)

- +2 INT, +2 CHA, -2 CON
- Gain bonus spells per day as if your spellcasting ability is +8 higher than it actually is. If you have multiple spellcasting classes, this bonus applies to all of them. This stacks with the bonus from the Apprentice or Atronach birthsigns.
- +1 spell save DC's for all spells you cast.
- -2 all saves vs. spells and spell-like abilities cast on you.
- +2 on saving throws vs. disease.
- Racial +2 Spellcraft and this skill is always in class.
- Racial +2 Alchemy.

## Argonian (lizardmen)

- +2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 CHA
- Water Breathing.
- Immune to poison.
- +4 on saving throws vs. disease.
- Low-light vision and Darkvision 60'.
- Swim speed 30' (This gives a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks.)
- **Burst of Speed:** As a swift action, gain +10' to your move speed and +2 dodge AC until the end of the next round. Usable a number of times per day equal to your dexterity bonus.

Roleplaying note: The "beast races" (Argonians and Khajit) are widely discriminated against because of their race.

*2014-05-18: Immunity to poison is intended. I could give them +8 to saves vs. poison, but that would practically make them immune to poison anyway. Note that Redguards also have +4 saves vs. poison.*

## Bosmer (wood elves)

- +2 DEX, +2 INT, -2 STR
- Racial +2 Stealth, +2 Handle Animal, and +2 Knowledge (Nature) and you are always considered trained in these skills.
- +2 racial bonus to saves vs. poison and disease.
- Woodland Stride per Ranger.
- Automatically proficient with shortbow, longbow, and composite shortbow/longbow.
- Gain Point Blank Shot feat. *(Note: As per house rules, this includes both Point Blank and Precise Shot.)*
- Gain Dodge feat.
- Low-light vision.
- SLA speak with animals 1/day

2014-05-18 - I have not traded Survival for Knowledge (Nature). To address Phil's comment about them being underpowered as anything except archers and stealthers, I am granting Dodge for free - is this OP?

## Breton
