# Food, Eating, and Cooking

Optional rules for eating and cooking food.

Mostly intended for roleplaying bonuses, but also provides mechanical advantages so that players are encouraged to eat. Eating also sinks a small amount of the party's resources.

## Overview

* PCs must eat, or they will eventually starve.
* PCs can cook food, using a Craft (Cooking) check. There is cooking equipment to make this easier. Fire helps.
* Eating food occasionally gives minor mechanical bonuses.


## Eating

You must eat, or you will starve to death.

* Going one day (24 hours) without a meal makes you [fatigued](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#fatigued).
* Going two days (48 hours) without a meal makes you [exhausted](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#exhausted).
* Every day after that, you suffer 1 point of CON damage until you die.

However, eating *too much* is also bad.

* You can eat up to three meals a day.
* If you eat more than three meals in a day, you are sickened.
* If you eat more than six meals in a day, you are nauseated. 

You are what you eat. Basic food is adequate, but better food will make you stronger. See *Food Bonuses* below.

Note: It isn't intended that the point of CON damage is immediately healed every night, per the [healing rules](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/injuryandDeath.htm#healing) - suggestions for better wording are welcome.

## Cooking

You can prepare meals using a Craft (cooking) check.

* More expensive food is better for you, but harder to cook (higher Craft DC.)
* Better cooking equipment gives a bonus to your Craft check.
* Cooking requires a fire or other heat source. If you don't have heat, you can only eat cold food i.e. trail rations.
