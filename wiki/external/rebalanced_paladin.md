----------


Current Version: v0.81

The paladin is the epitome of the holy knight in shining armor. A beacon of
heroic Good. Yet in the core books... it seems like there's no reason to
bother with her past level 6, especially since the Cleric can do what she does
just as well (Actually, better). However, this shall be the case no longer!

It should be said that if you're the sort of person who thinks core material
is all perfect and good and balanced, that Fighters can stand side by side
with Wizards at level 20 and such nonsense, this is not the fix for you.
However, if you do see the need for rectifying balance and making the paladin
a worthwhile class right up to high levels with greater power, versatility,
*and* flavor, then you may well have found the solution you've been looking
for!

This variant is mostly the same as the base paladin at lower levels, since the
paladin is pretty much fine there. It continues to increase the power of Lay
on Hands and allow it to use up some of its healing points to cure various
other ailments (and just throwing out the Remove Disease ability). It changes
smite/day into smite/encounter, since the high level paladin *should* be so
badass that she smites all day. It gives the paladin switchable auras to
support the party. It also rebuilds the paladin's spell list and gives her
more spells per day. At level 5, it allows the paladin to choose from a
variety different specializations instead of just getting a special mount
(which is now part of the mounted specialization), allowing for a variety of
different and unique styles. Further, the paladin has access to a new type of
feat, the "Smite Feat," which allows the paladin to expend smite attempts in
order to create a variety of other effects, enabling her to use her smite evil
ability to cover a variety of versatile circumstances and perform various
maneuvers.

The paladin is now a more powerful force in melee (and not just a couple
rounds per day!), who uplifts her comrades with her heroic and divine
presence, and an effective backup healer.

This class is still not on the power level of well-played full spellcasters
(Particularly at higher levels), and it is not intended to be. However, it
*is* relevant at higher levels, and is meant to be balanced against the
classes generally regarded as well built and balanced, such as the Rogue,
Warblade, Psychic Warrior, decent prestige classes, or... monsters of the
appropriate CR. It's meant to be in the upper-middle range of class balance.

Finally, this is a work in progress, and more material will be added in the
future.

And without further ado... I offer you...

**Aura of Good [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

The power of a paladin’s aura of good (see the [detect
good](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/detectGood.htm) spell) is equal to her
paladin level. It is _not_ a switchable aura.

**Detect Evil [(Sp)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities)**

At will, a paladin can use [detect
evil](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/detectEvil.htm), as the spell.

**Smite Evil [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Once per encounter, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee
attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1
extra point of damage per paladin level. This damage is not multiplied on a
critical, or by any other multiplier that would not count "bonus dice." If the
paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no
effect, but the ability is still used up for that encounter.

At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil
one additional time per encounter, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a
maximum of five times per encounter at 20th level. An encounter is considered
over when you do no strenuous action for 5 minutes or more.

**Divine Grace [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on
all saving throws, up to a maximum of her class level.

**Lay on Hands [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can
heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. She gains a pool of
healing, which allows her to heal a total number of hit points of damage equal
to her paladin level × her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her
healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn’t have to use it all at once.
A Paladin may fill this pool with a full minute (10 rounds) of concentration
and prayer. Refreshing the pool brings the Paladin's pool of healing back up
to the maximum (Paladin level × Charisma Bonus). She may fill her healing pool
a number of times per day equal to 1 + half her Charisma modifier (rounded
down).

Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal
damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a
successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.
The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage
after successfully touching an undead creature. The target may make a Will
save (DC 10+1/2 Paladin Level+Cha) to negate the damage.

The paladin's Lay on Hands gains additional capabilities as she progresses in
level as a paladin. The paladin may use all additional effects in conjunction
with healing, as long as she spends enough points.

**Switchable Auras**

All auras except Aura of Good are switchable as a move action. You may have
only one aura other than Aura of Good active at a given time. These auras
function while the paladin is conscious, but not while the paladin is
unconscious or dead. The paladin's auras only affect her allies, and not the
paladin herself.

**Aura of Courage [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

At 3rd level, the paladin may exude an aura of courage that inspires her
allies. Each ally within 30 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving
throws against fear effects. Aura of Courage's bonuses scale by level. At
level 8, allies gain +6 to saves against fear, and a +1 morale bonus to attack
rolls. At level 13, allies gain +8 to saves against fear, and a +2 morale
bonus to attack rolls. At level 18, allies gain immunity to fear, and +3
morale bonus to attack rolls. This is a switchable Aura.

**Hero's Courage [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).

**Divine Health [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural
and magical diseases.

**Turn Undead [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn
undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 2 + her
Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of her level.


**Specialization**

Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin may choose any of three abilities
representing three different specializations:

* Charging Smite (Aggressive)
* Special Mount (Mounted)
* Argent Bastion (Defensive)

See *Specializations* section below for more details.

**Panacean Touch [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Upon reaching 6th level, whenever a paladin expends at least 10 points of
healing from her lay on hands she may remove poison from any person she
touches, and whenever she spends at least 20 points of healing she may remove
disease from any person she touches. This is in addition to hit points
restored.

**Bonus Feats**

At 7th level, and again at 14th level, the Paladin gains a bonus feat. At each
such opportunity, a paladin may choose any Smite feat (new to the Rebalanced Paladin),
or a feat drawn from the following list. If a feat is labelled with "Aggressive", "Defensive", or "Mounted", then that feat may only be chosen by a paladin of the corresponding specialization.

* *All specializations*
	* Divine Cleansing (CW)
	* Divine Might (CW)
	* Divine Resistance (CW)
	* Divine Shield (CW)
	* Divine Vigor (CW)
	* Sacred Vengeance (CW)
	* Extra Smiting* (Revised - do not use CW version)
	* Divine Armor (PHB II)
	* Divine Justice (PHB II)
* *Defensive Specialization*
	* Shield Specialization (Defensive) (PHB II)
	* Armor Specialization (Defensive) (PHB II)
	* Agile Shield Fighter (Defensive) (PHB II)
	* Active Shield Defense (Defensive) (PHB II)
	* Improved Shield Bash (Defensive)
* *Mounted Specialization*
	* Mounted Combat (Mounted)
	* Mounted Archery (Mounted)
	* Ride-By Attack (Mounted)
	* Spirited Charge (Mounted)
	* Trample (Mounted)
* *Aggressive Specialization*
	* Intimidating Strike (Aggressive) (PHB II)
	* Power Attack (Aggressive)
	* Cleave (Aggressive)
	* Great Cleave (Aggressive)
	* Weapon Focus (Aggressive)

**Aura of Devotion [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

Upon reaching 8th level, the Paladin may exude an Aura of Devotion. While this
ability is active, the Paladin grants a +1 morale bonus to AC to all allies
within 30 feet. At level 13, this bonus increases to +2. At level 18, this
bonus increases to +3. This is a switchable aura.

**Revitalizing Touch [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Beginning at 9th level The Paladin can use her Lay on Hands ability to remove
ability damage from a person she touches when she heals at least 5 points per
point of ability damage to be removed (It is possible for only a portion of
ability damage to be restored if the paladin does not spend enough to cure
them all). This is in addition to hit points restored.

**Vigilance [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Upon reaching 11th level, the Paladin's ability to detect evil increases. When
she uses her Detect Evil ability, the area of effect is a 60-foot radius
centered on the Paladin, rather than a 60-foot cone.

**Refreshing Touch [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Beginning at 12th level Paladin can remove exhaustion, fatigue, sickness, and
nausea with a touch whenever she spends at least 10 points from her lay on
hands pool. This is in addition to hit points restored.

**Aura of Resolve [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

Beginning at 13th level, the paladin gains Aura of Resolve. While this ability
is active, the Paladin grants the ability to reroll one Fortitude save every
round to any ally within a 30ft radius of her. The decision to reroll must be
made after the roll is made but before the result is declared. This is a
switchable Aura.

**Break Enchantment [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Beginning at 16th level, the Paladin can break an enchantment with a touch
whenever she expends at least 40 points of healing from her lay on hands
ability. Her caster level for the purpose of this effect is equal to her
paladin caster level, just as if she had actually cast the Break Enchantment
spell. This is in addition to hit points restored.

**Constant Vigilance [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Upon reaching 17th level, the Paladin is always vigilant for any signs of
Evil, and her eyes begin to glow with an inner light. Her Detect Evil no
longer requires any concentration to maintain, and has an unlimited duration.

**Aura of Faith [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

At 18th level, the paladin gains Aura of Faith. While this ability is active,
the Paladin grants the ability to reroll one Will save every round to any one
ally within a 30ft radius of her. The decision to reroll must be made after
the roll is made but before the result is declared. This is a switchable Aura.

**Energizing Touch [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

Beginning at 19th level, Paladin may remove negative levels from a subject
whenever she spends at least 15 points from her lay on hands pool per negative
level the target is afflicted with (It is possible for only a portion of
negative levels to be restored if the paladin does not spend enough to cure
them all). This is in addition to hit points restored.


**A Hero Never Falls [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

At 20th level, the paladin's sheer strength of will drives her on when death
would claim lesser men. Once per day when a paladin would be reduced to 0 or
less hp or otherwise killed (such as by a death effect), she instead is
reduced to 1 hp. If the paladin would be killed by having an ability score
reduced to zero, that score is instead reduced to 1.


----------

## Specializations

Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin may choose any of three abilities
representing three different specializations: Charging Smite (Aggressive),
Special Mount (Mounted), and Argent Bastion (Defensive).

> **(Sidebar) Behind the Scenes: Specializations**
> 
> Specializations are designed in order to emphasize a paladin's specific
> fighting style, or to make certain choices more viable (For example, fighting
> with a sword and shield is typically a suboptimal choice of armament compared
> to a two-handed weapon).
>
> **DMs**: If a player in your campaign has an idea for
> a particular esoteric fighting style or whatever that might otherwise be less
> than viable, but is nonetheless interesting and supported by his character's
> flavor, you may consider designing a Specialization in order to facilitate
> this choice. Just decide what abilities it grants (usually 4, granted at level
> 5, 8, 11, and 15) and what bonus feats it makes available (as a rule of thumb,
> keep it to 5). Suddenly, the paladin designed around throwing weapons (perhaps
> the Paladin from Hellsing who throws holy bayonets, for example) becomes
> viable and more fun to play!
>
> In fact, you could even create a unique specialization for each church or
> faith within your campaign setting, guaranteeing that paladins of every faith
> will be even more unique! Essentially, it can be an efficient medium for
> creating class variants on the paladin, allowing new concepts without
> designing a full PrC or anything.



###  Argent Bastion (Defensive Specialization)


The paladin gains a number of abilities as she rises in level.

**Argent Bastion**

| Level  | Ability     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 5th    | Shield Ward |
| 8th    | Cover       |
| 11th   | Retribution |
| 15th   | Divine Wall |


**Shield Ward**

The Paladin gains Shield Ward as a bonus feat, even if the paladin does not
meet the prerequisites.

**Cover [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

Once per round, as long as the paladin is wielding a shield (and is not
flatfooted or otherwise prevented from taking action), the paladin may
interpose herself between an adjacent ally and an incoming attack as an
immediate action. The paladin absorbs all damage the damage from this single
attack, and any additional effects it might have (such as something requiring
a save, etc). You must decide to use this ability after the attacker
determines the attack has succeeded but before she rolls damage.

**Retribution**

The paladin gains Retribution* as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the
prerequisites.

**Divine Wall [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

As long as the paladin wields a shield, her square blocks line of effect for
all effects. For example, if allies hid behind the paladin when a dragon used
its breath weapon from the opposite side, it would only hit the paladin.


###  Charging Smite (Agressive Specialisation)

As PHB II variant.

### Special Mount [(Sp)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities) (Mounted Specialisation)

The paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal
steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy
warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).

Aa full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the
celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a
spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount immediately
appears adjacent to the paladin and remains until dismissed. The mount is the
same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a
particular mount from service.

Each time the mount is called, it appears with the same hp it had previously,
as well as any other effects it may have had (though some may have worn off
because of their duration). Whether the mount is with you or not, things like
poison run their course. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear
it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling)
effect.

When the paladin rests for 8 hours (or long enough to restore his spells), the
mount is restored to full hp.

Should the paladin’s mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any
equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty
days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the
mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the
paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

**The Paladin's Mount**

The paladin’s mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special
powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy
warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another
kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark
(for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.

A paladin’s mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the
purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal’s
HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

| Paladin Level |  Bonus HD |   Natural Armour Adj. | Strength Adj. |  INT | Special                                                                      |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|---------------|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5th           |   +2      |     +4                |   +1          |  6   | Empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws           |
| 8th           |   +4      |     +6                |   +2          |  7   | Improved speed                                                               |
| 11th          |   +6      |     +8                |   +3          |  8   | Command creatures of its kind                                                |
| 15th          |   +8      |     +10               |   +4          |  9   | Spell resistance                                                             |


**Paladin’s Mount Basics**

Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount’s kind, but make changes
to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the
table and described below.

**Bonus HD**

Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier,
as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount’s base attack and base save
bonuses. A special mount’s base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a
level equal to the mount’s HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves
(treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). The mount gains
additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a
monster’s Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Adj.**

The number on the table is an improvement to the mount’s existing natural
armor bonus.

**Str Adj.**

Add this figure to the mount’s Strength score.

**Int**

The mount’s Intelligence score.

**Empathic Link [(Su)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities)**

The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1
mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount’s eyes, but they can
communicate empathically.

Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so
misunderstandings are always possible.

Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item
or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar.

**Improved Evasion [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for
half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and
half damage if the saving throw fails.

**Share Spells**

At the paladin’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like
ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.

The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.
If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops
affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect
the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires.
Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her mount
(as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can
share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the
mount’s type (magical beast).

**Share Saving Throws**

For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the
paladin’s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to
saves, and it doesn’t share any other bonuses on saves that the master might
have.

**Improved Speed [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

The mount’s speed increases by 10 feet.

**Command [(Sp)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities)**

Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this
ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as
itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules,
and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount.
This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21
Concentration check to succeed if it’s being ridden at the time. If the check
fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the
mount’s daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + Â½ paladin’s
level + paladin’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect.

**Spell Resistance [(Ex)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities)**

A mount’s spell resistance equals its master’s paladin level + 5. To affect
the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount’s spell
resistance.


----------

## Spells

Beginning at 4th level, a Paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the Paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at
least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an
Paladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the Paladin’s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of
each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table:
Paladin Spells Per Day. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she
has a high Wisdom score. When Table: Paladin Spells Per Day indicates that the
Paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus
spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell
level. The Paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted
powers, as a cleric does.

A Paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot
lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare
and cast any spell on the Paladin spell list, provided that she can cast
spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her
daily prayer.

Through 3rd level, a Paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her
caster level is her Paladin level minus 3.

## Code of Conduct

A paladin must be of Lawful Good alignment, and abide by a higher standard of
morals and honor than the average Good-aligned person. Indeed, she is the
paragon of heroic Good, drawn to a higher cause. Truly she is a person of high
calibre, moral and otherwise.

There is a code of conduct presented in the PHB, but it really is better
classified as an example of a generic paladin's vows and code. However, in
your game being a paladin may mean quite a different thing altogether! After
all, not all settings are the same, nor are all paladins. They serve various
causes and deities, and the nature of Good and Evil is not always so
stereotypically straightforward in all settings. Your code should represent
the beliefs of your church or cause or whatever it is you, as a paladin, fight
for!

Talk with your DM about what it means to be a paladin in _your_ campaign, and
the implications of it. If you are the DM, consider this, and what it really
to be the paragon of good in your campaign. It should be noted that a single
mistake or lack of perfection should _not_ make a paladin fall. Indeed, is it
not the lack of perfection and ultimately human(oid) nature of such a heroic
figure that makes him all the more endearing and, truly, notable in calibre?
After all, any old celestial can be perfect, but a man has to work for it.

Instead, the paladin falls from grace if she _grossly_ violates her code (as
stated, yet all too often overlooked, in the PHB. This means that some minor
infraction would *not* make the Paladin fall), or if she changes alignment
from Lawful Good. Your alignment should be your overall personality and
outlook, not the result of the last action you took (although that last action
*could* be considered to grossly violate the paladin's code, of course. The
paladin's code is not synonymous with alignment). It should be extremely rare
for a single act to alter your alignment, and it certainly shouldn't be so if
the act was not done with wrongful intentions. Alignment changes should
usually be the result of fairly consistent behavior of a character.

**Ex-Paladins**

A paladin who ceases to be lawful good or grossly violates her code loses all
paladin spells and abilities. She may not progress any farther in levels as a
paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for
her violations (see the
[atonement](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/atonement.htm) spell
description), as appropriate.

Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character.

> **Sidebar: PrC Adaptation**
> Of course, it would seem that existing Paladin PrCs wouldn't fit well with the
> Rebalanced Paladin. One might ask "Hey, how does it make sense to get
> 2/encounter smites then get 1/day?" Fortunately for you, the Rebalanced
> Paladin was designed with easy adaptation in mind! For many prestige classes,
> adaptation is actually quite simple. Spellcasting doesn't need to be altered,
> as it continues to stay at "+1 per caster level." Fixing smite progressions is
> as simple as saying "You gain it per encounter, instead of per day." Those are
> the mainstays of the Rebalanced Paladin's power, and PrCs tend to give good
> benefits to make up for the loss of auras and Lay on Hands/specialization
> advancement. This is most of the work already for many paladin PrCs. In the
> case of abilities that are very similar to Smite Evil, smite feats should
> generally be allowed to apply (e.g. other Smite (alignment) feats). Indeed,

## New Feats

> **Sidebar: Behind the Scenes: Smite Feats**
> 
> Smites feats are designed to give added options and versatility for the
> paladin during combat. Quite simply, more options makes combat more dynamic,
> interesting, and fun for the player. For the most part, Smite feats are weaker
> than a simple normal Smite Evil attack when fighting a single evil foe, and
> this is completely intentional. Smite feats are instead useful in other
> situations. All smite feats work on foes of any alignment unless otherwise
> noted, and as such help the paladin to contribute more in combats against
> things like constructs, oozes, or an angry tyrannosaurus. In the case of
> Conviction, for example, you get basically half the benefit of Smite Evil
> against any foe. Additionally, certain smite feats are more useful than a
> smite in unique situations, allowing a paladin to be more effective in more
> situations. For example, against multiple foes, Judgment can carve a swath
> through weaker enemies.
> 
> Smite feats are designed much like maneuvers in Tome of Battle. Most of them
> are related to a single, offensive attack with an instantaneous effect, or at
> least one that doesn't last for more than one round. The idea is basically
> that things like timed buffs are the domain of Divine feats. If you intend to
> design your own smite feats, keep a few things in mind:
> 
> 1. Smite feats probably shouldn't have a duration that lasts very long, and
> should be related to some sort of action directly related to combat.
> 2. Smite feats should generally be weaker than a normal Smite Evil attack
against a single evil foe.

**New Feat Type: [Smite]**

A smite feat allows you to channel the holy energy used to smite evil enemies
iin new ways, expanding your options in combat.
All smite feats require the user to expend uses of their Smite Evil ability.
Only one use of Smite Evil may be applied to any single attack. All Smite
feats are considered Supernatural abilities, and cannot be used in any
situation that such abilities would not function (such as in an antimagic
field)

### Smite Feats

####  **Celestial Lightning [Smite]**

* A fearsome bolt of lightning streaks from the sky and strikes your upraised weapon, arcing out in all directions and striking down surrounding foes.
* **Prerequisite**: Holy Wrath (Electricity), Smite 3/encounter
* **Benefit**: By expending a smite attempt as a full-round action, you raise your weapon above your head, and a lightning bolt strikes your weapon before arcing off in all directions to hit other targets. This is treated as a Chain Lightning Spell, with a caster level equal to your level in smiting classes. The weapon is considered the initial target (but takes no damage).
* **Note**: Alternatively, the player may decide that the initial target is any other piece of equipment, or the character's body, as this is purely a flavor element.

####  **Consecration [Smite]**

* You channel fearsome holy energy into your weapon and slams it into the earth, unleashing the stored energy into the ground and uplifting the earth around you in a powerful shockwave.
* **Prerequisite**: Smite 4/encounter, Str 15
* **Benefit**: As a standard action, by expending a use of your smites per encounter, you can unleash a powerful surge of holy energy into the ground. You immediately make a bull rush attempt against all enemies within a 30ft radius of you, for the purposes of this attack, you are considered one size category larger than normal, and add your Charisma to the check rather than strength. Enemies may move further than 5 feet as if you had bullrushed and moved with them. Additionally, all enemies affected take damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

####  **Conviction [Smite]**

* Holy energy fills you with righteous conviction, driving you forward in battle.
* **Prerequisite**: Smite 1/encounter, Hero's Courage class feature, Cha 15
* **Benefit**: By expending a use of your Smite Evil ability, you gain a morale bonus on your attack roll equal to your Charisma bonus for a single attack.

####  **Divine Cross [Smite]**

* **Prerequisite**: Two Weapon Fighting, Smite 1/encounter
* **Benefit**: When you are wielding two weapons (or a double weapon) and use a smite attempt, you may instead make a smite attempt with both one primary weapon attack and one offhand attack, but only expend one use of your smites per encounter.

####  **Holy Wrath [Smite]**

* You summon holy energy in order to smite your foes.
* **Prerequisite:** Smite 2/encounter, Cha 13
* **Benefit:** As a standard action, you may expend a smite Evil attempt in order to create a burst of holy energy that damages a single target within Close range (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels). The energy deals damage equal to 1d6 per level of smiting class, and the target get a reflex save (DC 10+1/2 paladin level+Cha) for half damage. Half of the damage dealt is of either Fire, Electricity, or Cold damage (Chosen at the time the feat is taken), and the other half is pure divine energy, which is not subject to energy resistance.
* **Special:** This feat may be taken multiple times. Each time, the paladin's holy wrath may correspond to a different element. For example, a paladin could take the Holy Wrath (Electricity) and then take Holy Wrath (Fire).

####  **Inspiration [Smite]**

* You inspire your allies by channeling a divine presence.
* **Prerequisite**: Smite 2/encounter, Cha 15, switchable aura class feature
* **Benefit**: You may expend a smite attempt as a swift action to activate this ability. For the next round, the Paladin's switchable aura's radius is tripled, and any bonuses are doubled. In the case of a benefit that may normally be used once per round, it may be used twice this round.

####  **Judgment [Smite]**

* You channel pure holy energy into your weapon, and unleash a holy explosion with a swing, hurtling forward in a line through your enemies.
* **Prerequisite**: Cha 15, Smite 3/encounter, Holy Wrath
* **Benefit**: You may expend a use of your Smite Evil ability to use this ability as a standard action. You call forth a violent burst of holy energy, dealing 1d6 sacred damage per level of smiting class in a 5 foot wide line. The length of the line is equal to 25+5 feet/2 levels of smiting class. Targets get a reflex save (DC 10+1/2 paladin level+Cha) for half damage.

####  **Reckoning [Smite]**


* You channel powerful holy energy into an overwhelmingly forceful blow that stuns your enemy.
* **Prerequisite**: Str 13, Smite 2/encounter
* **Benefit**: You may expend one use of your Smite Evil as a standard action in order to make a single melee attack. An enemy struck by this attack must make a Fort save (DC 10+1/2 level+Cha modifier) or be dazed for one round (In addition to taking normal damage from the attack).

####  **Retribution [Smite]**

* You channel holy energy into your shield which is unleashed when you are attacked.
* **Prerequisite**: Smite Evil 3/encounter, Shield Specialization
* **Benefit**: As an immediate action when an opponent attempts to strike you, you may expend a use of your Smite Evil to add your Charisma bonus to your Shield Bonus to AC against this attack. If the opponent's attack misses, they are automatically knocked back 5 feet by the unleashed holy energy and take damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier. The movement provokes an attack of oppurtunity from anyone but you.

####  **Vindication [Smite]**

* By channelling holy energy into your weapon, it can cross the nexus between planes and harm ethereal foes.
* **Prerequisite**: Cha 13, Smite Evil 1/encounter
* **Benefit**: You may expend a Smite Evil use to give all attacks for 1 round the benefit of the Ghost Touch weapon enhancement.

### General Feats

####  **Holy Arrow [General]**

* Your presence and faith guide your arrows true. Your faith is not limited to the single-minded close combat of your peers.
* **Prerequisite**: Smite Evil 1/encounter, Point Blank Shot
* **Benefit**: You may use the Smite (alignment) ability with ranged weapons.

####  **Extra Lay on Hands [General]**

* You are a focused healer, and are able to draw upon more holy power in order to heal yourself and your allies.
* **Prerequisite:**Wis 13, Lay on Hands class feature
* **Benefit:**You may refresh your Lay on Hands pool one extra time per day.

####  **Extra Smiting [General]**

* You can make more smite attacks.
* **Prerequisites**: Smite ability, base attack bonus +4
* **Benefit**: When you take this feat, you gain one extra smite per encounter.
* **Note**: This replaces the Extra Smiting feat written in Complete Warrior, which does not apply to the Rebalanced Paladin.
